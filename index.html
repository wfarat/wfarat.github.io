            <h3>Hello! My name is Władysław Farat.</h3>
            <p> I'm a rookie full stack developer, located in Poland. I was interested in computer programming for many years, but I've been mostly doing another stuff for last 10 years.
                When I was 17 I've created my first online game server along with website, database and remote server. I've reached a database of 40000 accounts and a huge traffic on my website.
                Unfortunately, my server got attacked by DDoS attacks, which were at that time hard to deflect. I wasn't discouraged and I've created another huge server which even crossed 1000 online users at the same moment.
                However I fell again, because I've lacked skills to protect my server from DDoS. This failure caused my drive to programming to burn out and for next 10 years+ I've been doing close to nothing related to programming.
            </p>
            <p>That changed some time ago when I've decided to come back to programming and started learning on codecademy full-stack developer course. Currently I'm around 30% progress and I'm struggling to 
                learn more and more every day.
            </p>
